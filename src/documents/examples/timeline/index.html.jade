      td(style='vertical-align:top;')

        div(style='text-align: center;') LEFT button ROTATES. RIGHT button PANS. MIDDLE wheel ZOOMS.
      td(style='vertical-align:top;')
        p Instructions: 
        ol
          li Scroll through the tracks in the timeline using the right-hand side scrollbar.
          li Double click in a track to insert a new keyframe there.
          li Single click on a keyframe to open an awful dialog for editing the value of the joint at that keyframe.
          li Change the value to something like "-1" or "1" or "1.57".
          li Click OK to close that awful dialog that I didn't design.
          li Click the Play button on the left. Your animation should loop!
          li You can move your keyframe by clicking and dragging it.
          li Repeat as necessary to make a cool animation, <b>BUT</b>
          li Don't waste too much time, because you can't save anything yet. It's not my bug, I'm trying to fix it.
        p.
          This is a clumsy hack. But imagine something similar, but less buggy, 
          with great performance (this version seems to get slower as you add keyframes) 
          and that saves your work automatically so you can restart your browser and it will all still be there, 
          and there is an "Export to hubo-read-trajectory" button.
