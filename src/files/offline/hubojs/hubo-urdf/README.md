Commit: d4b04dfa8d
Modifications from original: 
* I have changed the the path names in model.urdf so the URDF loader has an easier time.
* I have added a neck, so Body_HNP is no longer a direct child of Body_Torso.
* I plan to reduce the file size and make the model prettier if possible.
* I plan to add texture maps. Don't know how yet.

Original Readme:
-model.urdf
  contains the Hubo urdf model

-manifest.xml 
  description file of the robot

-meshes folder
 Contains all the geometry meshes
